# Time Series Analysis 2 - Final Project

## Transformers for Time Series Forecasting

This repository contains the final project for the Time Series Analysis 2 course, exploring the application of Transformer architectures to time series forecasting problems.

## Overview

Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing and are increasingly being applied to time series analysis. This project investigates their effectiveness, implementation, and performance compared to traditional forecasting methods.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
```

### Create and activate virtual enviroment

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # In Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install the requeriments

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Place your time series data in the `data/` directory
2. **Exploration**: Start with the notebooks in `notebooks/` for exploratory analysis
3. **Training**: Use the scripts in `src/` to train Transformer models
4. **Evaluation**: Review results and visualizations in the `results/` directory

## Key Features

- Implementation of Transformer architectures for time series forecasting
- Comparative analysis with traditional forecasting methods
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualizations
- Modular code structure for easy experimentation

## Methodology

Our approach includes:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
